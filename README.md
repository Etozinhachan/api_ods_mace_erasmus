# FAKE AI

# Trying to find any interesting project? I have one [here](https://fakeai.onrender.com/)

# Why was the project even created?

This project was started because of the Erasmus project i went to on December 2023, we basically were asked to make a project on a school called KITM on Kaunas, Lithuania ( the school was REALLY cool i really liked honestly )

# My goals for the future

My goal with this project is to basically create an actual AI, however, as im not even close to that, i'll just add some cool features ( i'll probably merge this project with the C# compiler api as i think it would be really nice my Fake Ai compiling C#.

# Existing Features

Ok so, for now the FakeAi it's only mocking an AI, it's basically an API that instead of using an AI to generate responses it generates some hard coded responses using a really simple code just so everyone has a little differente experience while using it, so... Lets breakdown the features!

## Login/register System

it receives a json like that to both /api/users/register and /api/users/login with POST methods:
```json
{
  "UserName": "Etozinhachan",
  "passHash": "1234"
}
```

and if everything goes right with your request it will return an OkResult() with a erai-jwt-token header ( you better get it when you login because you gonna have to do use that token to do ANY chat related request to the api )


# EVERYTHING FROM NOW ON WILL NEED AN 'Authorization Bearer putTokenInHere' with the putTokenInHere being any valid jwt token generated by the api when logging-in / registring

## Creating a chat

/api/chat/conversation with POST methods:

it receives a json like that:
```json
{
  "prompt": "Hello"
}
```

and if everything goes alright it returns the chat created with that prompt
```json
{
  "id": "fad4f8a8-c616-4749-970e-a4df75ed4738",
  "user_id": "5ac04742-b0e0-4697-bcc3-ecec66f03040",
  "userPrompts": [
    {
      "id": "77eff477-3fc2-4de4-97d0-e57bddc7e1d0",
      "conversation_id": "fad4f8a8-c616-4749-970e-a4df75ed4738",
      "prompt": "Hello",
      "prompt_number": 0
    }
  ],
  "chatPrompts": [],
  "chat_number": 0
}
```


## 
```json

```
